# AI Music Generation Project ðŸŽ¶  

### **Overview**  
This project leverages cutting-edge AI technology to transform user prompts into beautifully composed music. Using the **Gemini model** for advanced prompt engineering, it generates precise music notes based on user input. A custom-built algorithm then processes these notes to compose a unique audio file, all seamlessly deployed in a **Django** framework.  

### **Features**  
- AI-powered interpretation of user prompts to generate music notes.  
- Custom algorithm for composing high-quality, personalized audio tracks.  
- Fully deployed and scalable web application using Django.  

### **Workflow**  
1. User provides a detailed music prompt.  
2. The Gemini model generates corresponding music notes.  
3. Custom algorithm composes music from the notes.  
4. The final audio file is delivered to the user.  

### **Technologies Used**  
- **Gemini Model** for AI prompt engineering.  
- **Django** for backend development and deployment.  
- **Python** for custom algorithm design and implementation.
